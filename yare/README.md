# Yare

Procedural macro based parameterized testing library. Run a test case with many different inputs.
Test cases can be defined using the 'parameterized' attribute instead of the 'test' attribute.

### Examples:

<br>

**Example: Add5**

```rust
fn add5<T: Into<u32>>(component: T) -> u32 {
    component.into() + 5
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use yare::parameterized;

    ide!();
    
    #[parameterized(
        zero_plus_five = { 0, 5 },
        one_plus_five = { 1, 6 },
        two_plus_five = { 2, 7 },
    )]
    fn test_add5(input: u16, expected: u32) {
        assert_eq!(add5(input), expected);
    }
}
```

**Example: Fruits**

```rust
enum Fruit {
    Apple,
    Bramble(BrambleFruit),
    Pear,
}

trait NameOf {
    fn name_of(&self) -> &str;
}

impl NameOf for Fruit {
    fn name_of(&self) -> &str {
        match self {
            Fruit::Apple => "apple",
            Fruit::Bramble(fruit) => fruit.name_of(),
            Fruit::Pear => "pear",
        }
    }
}

enum BrambleFruit {
    Blackberry,
}

impl NameOf for BrambleFruit {
    fn name_of(&self) -> &str {
        match self {
            BrambleFruit::Blackberry => "blackberry",
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use yare::parameterized;
    
    #[parameterized(
        apple = { Fruit::Apple, "apple" },
        pear = { Fruit::Pear, "pear" },
        blackberry = { Fruit::Bramble(BrambleFruit::Blackberry), "blackberry" },
    )]
    fn a_fruity_test(fruit: Fruit, name: &str) {
        assert_eq!(fruit.name_of(), name)
    }
}
```

### Imports

If you prefer not to import this library (with `use yare::parameterized;`) in every test module, you can put
the following snippet at the top of your crate root:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
#[macro_use]
extern crate yare;
```

### IDE 'run test' intent

IntelliJ IDEA recognizes test cases and provides context menus which allow you to run tests within a certain scope
(such as a module or a single test case). For example, in IntelliJ you can usually run individual test cases by clicking
the ▶ icon in the gutter. Unfortunately, attribute macros are currently not expanded by `intellij-rust`.
This means that the IDE will not recognize test cases generated as a result of attribute macros (such as the
`yare` macro published by this crate). 

A workaround can be found below (if you have a better solution, please feel free to open an issue; thank you in advance!)

```rust
fn squared(input: i8) -> i8 {
  input * input  
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    use yare::parameterized as pm;
    use yare::ide;
        
    mod squared_tests { // <--
        use super::*;

        ide!(); // <--
    
        #[pm(
            two_squared = {2, 4}
        )]
        fn test_squared(input: i8, output: i8) {
            assert_eq!(squared(input), output);
        }
    }
}
```

Here we created an empty test case (using the `ide!()` macro) which will mark the surrounding module as 'containing test cases'. In
the gutter you will find the ▶ icon next to the module. This allows you to run test cases per module.

Note: `intellij-rust` does expand declarative macro's (with the new macro engine which can be
selected in the 'settings' menu), such as this `ide!` macro.
